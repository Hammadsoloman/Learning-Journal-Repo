## How Do I write the script for JavaScript ?
1.	It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

2.	The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

3.	If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.

# How To CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT

## JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an
HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.

 ## PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT?     
These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.
1. HTML ONLY Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site:
its content. Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all users, and load quite quickly on
slow connections
2. HTML+CSS Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself.
You can use the same style sheet with all of your site, making your sites faster to load and easier to maintain. Or you can use
different style sheets with the same content to create different views of the same data.
3. HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the si te.
Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on severa l pages
(making the site faster to load and easier to maintain).

## When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML
<script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.The HTML <script> element is used to load the JavaScript file into the page. It has an attribute called src, whose value is the path to the script you created.
 This tells the browser to find and load the script file .
