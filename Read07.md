# JavaScript!
##  ACCESS CONTENT You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page 
• Select any elements that have a c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of ema i 1

## MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element
• Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
• Change the size or position of an <i mg> element

## PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image. 
• A mortgage calculator could collect values from a fo rm, perform a ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).

## REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading


## What is ascript?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following:
1.	RECIPES
2.	HANDBOOKS
3.	MANUALS

## EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.

## OPERATORS

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

•	JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class.

## STRING OPERATOR

There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.


## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements)*.
