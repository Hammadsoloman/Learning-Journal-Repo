## Why we should organize the information into sections or pages in our website?

•	The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped. 

•	To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting.

## What is the wireframe?

###### A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

#### Visual hierarchy : refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what
they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being
displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

### New Html 5 Layout Elements
* HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.
