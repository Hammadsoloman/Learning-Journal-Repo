# What is a remote in Git?
* A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.
In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state. Instead, it only consists of the .git versioning data
