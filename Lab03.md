# Revisions and the Cloud
* I learned a lot in this lecture; like how we can connect VS with GitHub and the process that we will do after we apply our job.also, I gained lot of new word that we will use in this course.

##### Now let me mention most important things that I learned.

## What is the difference between Local Version Control and Centralized Version Control?

*Many years ago, programmers created Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
*The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

## Why we use Git?
1.Reduce risk of data loses.
2.Enables collaboration between multiple developers on a software project.
3.allowes you to track file revision.

## What is the cloning?

By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.
The Life Cycle of File Status
1.	After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified because of changes made after the previous commit.
2.	You stage the modified file.
3.	Then, you commit staged changes.

## What the process that we need to Tracking and Staging a New File?
•	Add
•	Commit
•	Puch
